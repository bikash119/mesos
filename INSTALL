Instructions for getting Mesos running out of the box can be found on the github wiki at: http://github.com/mesos/mesos/wiki.

Running out of the box:
-----------------------
1) Download 
2) ./configure (use ./configure --help to see options, also you can use ./configure.template.<your-architecture> for some known architectures.
3) ./make

Now you should be able to run the mesos binaries that were put into the bin directory.

Running a Mesos cluster on EC2:
-------------------------------
1) Launch a mesos master, view the master's webui and copy down its LibProcess PID, in the form 1@<IP_ADD>:<PORT_NUM>
2) Run the following command to launch a slave using our mesos-slave-ami:
      ec2-run-instances ami-XXXXX -d url=<MASTER_PID>
   This slave should automatically join the running master.


Installing as a production deployment:
--------------------------------------
NOTE: This functionality has only been tested on Linux so far.
The Mesos maste and slave binaries can also be installed to be run as a daemons. To do this, Mesos can be integrated into Linux System-V style daemon management by use of the files mesos-slave-init-d and mesos-slave-default. To set this up, do the following:


== Setting up the mesos-slave as a daemon ==

./configure
make
make install
#create and edit /usr/local/mesos/conf/mesos.conf to contain the following line:
#url=1@my-mesos-master:<master-port>
cp src/deploy/mesos-slave-init-d /etc/init.d/mesos-slave
cp src/deploy/mesos-slave-default /etc/default/mesos-slave
update-rc.d mesos-slave defaults # this causes the mesos-slave daemon to be run at system startup


== Setting up the mesos-master as a daemon ==

This is not yet very functional
